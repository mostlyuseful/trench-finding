# Trench finding

This repo contains a very simple algorithm to find and classify edges, trenches and ridges in a robust and repeatable manner.

I stumbled across this technique a long time ago and couldn't find any other implementation of it in the meantime. Please notify me if I am not the proud inventor :)

It's not pretty, but it's out there now!
